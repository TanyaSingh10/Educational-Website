            <h2>Our Certificates & Online Program</h2>
            <p>PHAGWARA: Faculty member at the Department of Punjabi Language of Lovely Professional University (LPU), Dr Paramjeet Singh Kattu has been declared winner of national ‘Silver Lotus (Rajat Kamal) Award’. It is for his feature length documentary-drama film- "The Saviour: Brigadier Pritam Singh". This film has won ‘the Best Investigative Film’ award at the 68th National Film Awards, under the non-feature film category.</p><br>
            <p>LPU Chancellor Dr Ashok Kumar Mittal congratulated the hard working creative faculty across the multi departments at the university. A 10-member jury led by its Chairperson- renowned filmmaker Vipul Shah reported to Information and Broadcasting Minister Anurag Thakur about the winners, under different categories. Hon’ble Minister Mr Thakur announced the awards and congratulated winners for their outstanding works and achievements thereupon. For this, LPU’s Prof Dr Kattu will receive the national ‘Silver Lotus Award’, and also a cash prize of Rs 50, 000.</p><br>
            <p>Extremely happy, LPU’s faculty Dr Kattu shares: “Being a research scholar and academician, I have great leaning towards research based subjects. By interest, I am also a filmmaker, with a decade long experience of filmmaking. This is my first feature length (80 Minutes) film project. Brigadier Pritam Singh was a war hero, who was also awarded the Military Cross during the Second World War. He led a fierce chivalrous fight to defend Poonch (J&K) and its residents, during the 1947-48 war against Pakistan. However, he was court-martialled from the Army due to certain allegations.”</p><br>
            <p>Without much data documented on Brig Pritam Singh, the filmmaker Dr Kattu and his team dived into research and took over two years to compile, shoot and eventually finalize the film. He and his team presented the versions of people who fought with Brigadier Singh. Dr. Kattu adds, “We interviewed Army experts including Shiv Kunal Verma (Indian military historian and a documentary filmmaker), advocate Maj Navdeep Singh (retd) and many more, and covered the entire ground of a thorough investigation.” Dr. Satwant Singh from Punjabi Department (LPU) is also part of this film as Assistant Director and Additional Dialogue writer.</p><br>
            <p>This film has already won in many prominent national and international film festivals, as in Los Angeles Film Awards 2021, 12th Dada Saheb Phalke Film Festival 2022 and many more. This film is made on international standards, and will soon be released on an OTT platform.</p><br>
            <p>Worth mentioning, established in the year 1954, the prestigious awards are administered annually by the Government of India’s Directorate of Film Festivals, under the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. This year’s awards announcement honoured films from 2020 as well, due to COVID-19-related delays. Already declared, the awards are yet to be presented to the winners by the President of India. This is followed by the inauguration of the National Film Festival, where the award-winning films are screened for the public. The awards aim at encouraging study and appreciation of cinema as an art form, and dissemination of information and critical appreciation of this art-form.</p><br>
            <p>Because Lovely Professional University Online upheld its requirements for offering high-quality education, the university was granted UGC-DEB recognition. The Government of India established the University Grants Commission as a statutory agency to uphold the required standards for higher education in India. Universities that have received UGC recognition are legitimate, and all of their courses are recognized worldwide.

                On the Jalandhar-Delhi G.T., the LPU campus is close to the university and is easily reachable by both road and train. From the university, students may quickly go to airports, bus stops, and railway stations.
                
                The prestigious European Commission recently awarded Lovely Professional University (LPU) a project worth 9 crores to oversee a group of 11 universities researching sports education in India, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia as part of the Erasmus Plus project, as reported by the top news source The Hindu.
                
                The institution offers services like an online gateway for students to get in touch with it, one-on-one contact programs, job fairs at various locations, online study materials, etc.
                
                Numerous courses in areas including management, commerce, the arts, computer applications, etc. are available through the institution.</p><br>
            <p>To help students with a range of administrative and academic tasks including paying fees, receiving receipts, getting ID cards, etc., each student gets a personal account called “My Account.”

                Students are kept up to date on all university events through personalized messages, notifications, and reminders delivered through electronic communication.
                
                Course Connect: This option gives information on the student’s past or present enrollment status in the course.
                The e-Resources section, which offers more than 3540 academic resources, including self-study materials, program manuals, previous year’s test questions, assignments, etc., is the most important part of the e-connect.
                
                Exam Connect: This function is essential since it gives access to all the test-related details, including the date and time, venue, admit cards, score cards, results, and questions from previous years’ exams.
                This service allows students to register online for the Personal Contact Program (PCP) (PCP). It also offers the guidelines, schedule, etc., for the PCP for various courses.
